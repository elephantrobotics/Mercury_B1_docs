# Linux system environment

The system comes with Ubuntu (V-20.04) system and built-in **ROS2 Galactic** development environment. There is no need to build and manage it. You only need to update the `mercury_x1_ros2` package.

`mercury_x1_ros2` is a ROS2 package launched by Elephant Robot for its Mercury X1 series robotic arms.

ROS2 project address: [http://github.com/elephantrobotics/mercury_x1_ros2](http://github.com/elephantrobotics/mercury_x1_ros2)

## 1 Update mercury_x1_ros2 package

In order to ensure that users can use the latest official packages in a timely manner, you can enter the `/home/er` folder through the file manager, open the ROS2 environment terminal, and then run the command update:

```bash
# Clone the code on github
git clone https://github.com/elephantrobotics/mercury_x1_ros2.git # Please check the attention section below before deciding whether to execute this command
cd ~/mercury_x1_ros2      # Back to work area
colcon build --symlink-install # Build the code in the workspace, --symlink-install: Avoid having to recompile python scripts every time you adjust them
source install/setup.bash # add environment variables


# Compile the function package separately:
# If you only compile "turn_on_mercury_robot", you need to execute the command:
colcon build --packages-select turn_on_mercury_robot
```

**Note:** If the `mercury_x1_ros2` folder already exists in the `/home/er` directory, you need to delete the original `mercury_x1_ros2` before executing the above command. Among them, `er` in the directory path is the user name of the system.

So far, the ROS2 environment construction has been completed.You can learn [the basics of ROS2](11.2.2-ROS2_Basics.md) or [ROS2 use cases](11.2.4-BasicFunction.md)
