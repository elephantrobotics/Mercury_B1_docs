# Linux system environment

The system comes with Ubuntu (V-20.04) system when leaving the factory, with a built-in development environment. There is no need to set up and manage it. Just update the `mercury_x1_ros` package.

`mercury_x1_ros` is a ROS1 package launched by Elephant Robot for its Mercury X1 series robotic arms.

ROS1 Project address: [http://github.com/elephantrobotics/mercury_x1_ros](http://github.com/elephantrobotics/mercury_x1_ros)

Robotic arm API driver library address: [https://github.com/elephantrobotics/pymycobot](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/pymycobot)

## 1 Update the mercury_ros package

In order to ensure that users can use the latest official packages in a timely manner, you can enter the `/home/er/` folder through the file manager, open the ROS1 environment terminal, and then run the update command:

```bash
# Clone the code on github
git clone https://github.com/elephantrobotics/mercury_x1_ros.git # Please check the attention section below before deciding whether to execute this command
cd ~/catkin_ws     # Back to work area
catkin_make # Build the code in the workspace
source devel/setup.bash # add environment variable
```

**Note:** If the `mercury_x1_ros` folder already exists in the `/home/er` directory, you need to delete the original `mercury_x1_ros` first and then execute the above command. Among them, `er` in the directory path is the user name of the system. If there are any inconsistencies, please modify them.

So far, the ROS1 environment construction has been completed.You can learn [the basics of ROS](11.1.2-ROS_Basics.md) or [ROS use cases](11.1.4-BasicFunction.md).
