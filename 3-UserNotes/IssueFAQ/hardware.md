## 1 About structure

**Q: What is the role of ATOM in the robotic arm?**

- A: ATOM mainly controls the sports algorithm of robotic arm, including positive sports, solution, speeding, speed synchronization, multi -power interpolation, coordinate conversion, etc. Programs related to Atom are not open source.

**Q: During the use process, the motor automatically cuts off the power. Why?**

- A: The motor has been used for a long time with heat protection. This phenomenon is a normal phenomenon and can be continued after a few minutes.

## 2 About parameters

**Q: What is the speed of the robotic arm?**

- A: Run the speed of 180 degrees/second.

**Q: Can the adaptive clip holder be completely closed?**

- A: There will be a certain gap between chin, and they are not completely closed. You can adjust it by increasing the thickness of the interval between them.

**Q: How to fix the USB camera at the end of the robotic arm?**

- A: You need to be fixed with flange and you can buy it separately.
