#### 1 E-stop circuit terminal: connected with the E-stop button box, it can be used to control the emergency stop of the robot
>**Note**: The emergency stop switch must be connected to the robot in use, and ensure that the emergency stop switch circuit is connected.

#### 2 Digital Outputs:
It includes 6 digital output signals that interact with other devices that together form an important part of the automation system.
The output signal is in PNP form, and the following is a schematic diagram of the external wiring:

#### 4 Network port: A network port is a port used for network data connections. Users can use the Ethernet interface for communication and interaction between the PC and the robot system, as well as Ethernet communication with other devices.

#### 5 Power input interface: This interface is connected to the DC24V power adapter interface
 
#### 6 Power Switch: Control the total power input on and off, when it is off, the controller is also powered off

#### 7 R-USB: 4Pin interface, the right arm camera connects to USB through this interface

#### 8 L-USB: 4Pin port, the left arm camera connects to USB through this port

#### 9 USB3.0 interface: the interface for data connection with serial bus standard 3.0, users can use the USB interface to copy program files, and can also use the USB interface to connect mouse, keyboard and other peripherals
