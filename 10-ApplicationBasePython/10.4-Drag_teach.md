```python

from pymycobot import Mercury
import time
ml = Mercury("/dev/ttyTHS0")
mr = Mercury("/dev/ttyACM0")

ml.power_on()
mr.power_on()
# Left arm begins trajectory recording
ml.drag_teach_save()
# Recording duration is 10 seconds
time.sleep(10)
# Stop recording
ml.drag_teach_pause()
time.sleep(1)
# Start executing the recorded motion trajectory, only once
ml.drag_teach_execute()
