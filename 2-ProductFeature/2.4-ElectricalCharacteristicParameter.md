#### 1 E-stop circuit terminal: connected with the E-stop button box, it can be used to control the emergency stop of the robot
>**Note**: The emergency stop switch must be connected to the robot in use, and ensure that the emergency stop switch circuit is connected.

#### 2 Digital Outputs:
It includes 6 digital output signals that interact with other devices that together form an important part of the automation system.
The output signal is in PNP form, and the following is a schematic diagram of the external wiring:
